        Here we have a demo example of how your data can be sent to the cloud without the cloud knowing what your data is. The cloud is hosting a diabetes predicting model trained with public data. You can fill-out a questionaire about your health information and your given information will be encrypted and sent to the cloud.
        <br>
        The result generated from the cloud can then be decrypted by you using your private key and you can see the test results based on your given information.
